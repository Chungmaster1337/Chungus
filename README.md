# CHUNGUS Symbolic Trust Architecture

**CHUNGUS** (Compartmentalized Heuristic Unit for Non-Generalizable Unforgeable Symbolics) is a novel post-cryptographic trust model. It supplements traditional key-based enforcement with symbolic logic interpretation, visual layout attestation, timing synchronization, and quorum-based resolution to govern data access and interpretation.

**What CHUNGUS Is Not** CHUNGUS is not a direct replacement for standard cryptographic methodologies.
## Abstract

In contrast to conventional architectures where access is determined by secret possession or policy enforcement, CHUNGUS enforces interpretive trust. Meaning cannot emerge from data unless symbolic conditions are provably satisfied. CHUNGUS introduces:

- **Foreign Key (FK) resolution via symbolic logic**  
- **Visual CHUNGUS Attestation Layer (VCAL)** to validate circuit topology  
- **Symbolic Logic Frame Protocol (SLFP)** for synchronized execution  
- **Quorum-based interpretation** for anti-forgery and redundancy  
- **Non-cryptographic symbolic blockchain** for state immutability  

The system is layered, observable, fail-closed, and designed for high-assurance environments where trust must be externally provable—not just assumed.

## How to Engage

- **Review**: Read the whitepaper, explore the system model, and examine proposed implementations.
- **Critique**: Open an [Issue](../../issues) for any technical challenge, flaw, or suggestion.
- **Extend**: Fork the repository, propose enhancements, or simulate CHUNGUS under FPGA or Redstone.
- **Discuss**: Use [Discussions](../../discussions) to ask questions, brainstorm, or debate components.

## Target Audience
